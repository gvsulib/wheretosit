# HW2: Personality quiz; Chrome extension 

You are required to complete two parts of the assignment:

- **Personality Quiz**: This is a web page with a Buzzfeed-style personality test. Modify `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` as necessary to complete the web page. 
  - `constants.js` and `provided-style.css` are provided. You should not need to modify these files; please keep all your JS and CSS in `script.js` and `style.css` respectively. 
- **Evil Extension**: This is an extension that changes all instances of there/their/they're to the wrong kind of their/there. Modify `evil-extension/page.js` as directed to compete the extension. 
  - `evil-extension/manifest.json` does not need to be modified.

There is an **optional** part 3 for extra credit:
- **Twitter Gardener**: When you click "Start Gardening" in the action menu, you can click on Tweets of a Twitter Feed and their text contents change to positive affirmations. This part is totally optional, but if you wish to complete it, you should only need to modify `twitter-gardener-EXTRA-CREDIT/page.js`.
  - `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, and `popup.js` in the same directory do not have to be modified.
